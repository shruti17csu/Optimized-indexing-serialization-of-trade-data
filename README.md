# Optimized-indexing-serialization-of-trade-data
- made computationally effective solution to load 5minute to every trade made by 10,000 companies in 2 years, written in C++<br>
- program reads market data from multiple files, divides the data into five-minute intervals,
processes the data concurrently using multiple threads, sorts the selected data, and writes it to an
output file.<br>
- C++ Coding Challenge.cpp is the main script where as dummy data code.ipynb is the python code to generate dummy data<br>
- explaination.pdf gives you full understanding of the project<br>
